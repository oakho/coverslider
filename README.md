# coverSlider

A multidirectionnal cover slider built on top of jQuery. Althought It works It's still pretty unstable and needs some reworking until I can release a stable version ready for production.

## Getting Started
Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max].

[min]: https://raw.github.com/oakho/coverSlider/master/dist/coverSlider.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/oakho/coverSlider/master/dist/coverSlider.js

In your web page:

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="dist/coverSlider.min.js"></script>
<script>
jQuery(function($) {
  $("#coverSlider").coverSlider();
});
</script>
```

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

### Important notes
Please don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the `src`subdirectory!
